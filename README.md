# Watch Her - Women Safety CCTV Prototype üöß

## Overview

**Watch Her** is a prototype AI-powered CCTV system designed for women's safety applications. This work-in-progress project focuses on processing video streams (webcam or video files) to detect persons and classify their gender in real-time, enhancing security monitoring capabilities.

## üéØ Current Features

- **Video Processing**: Supports both video file upload and webcam streaming
- **Person Detection**: Advanced face detection using OpenCV's DNN-based models
- **Gender Classification**: Binary gender classification (Male/Female) with confidence scores
- **Real-time Analysis**: Process video frames with visual annotations and statistics
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Green boxes for females, red boxes for males
- **Processing Statistics**: Detailed analysis summary with detection counts
- **Privacy-Focused**: Videos processed temporarily, no permanent storage
- **Web Interface**: Multi-tab Gradio interface for different input methods

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV with pre-trained DNN models
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow and Caffe model formats
- **Frontend**: Gradio for web interface
- **Backend**: Python with NumPy for image processing

## üìã How to Use

### Video Upload Tab
1. **Upload Video**: Choose a video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
2. **Process**: Click "Process Video" button
3. **Wait**: Processing time depends on video length (max 1000 frames for demo)
4. **Download**: Get the processed video with annotations

### Webcam Tab
1. **Record**: Use your webcam to record a video
2. **Process**: Click "Process Webcam Video" button
3. **View Results**: Get processed video with real-time annotations

### Visual Output
Each detected person will be highlighted with:
- **Green boxes**: Female detections
- **Red boxes**: Male detections
- **Labels**: Gender + confidence score
- **Statistics**: Summary of all detections

## üé® Model Information

### Face Detection
- **Model**: OpenCV DNN Face Detector
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Input Size**: 300x300 pixels
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.7

### Gender Classification
- **Model**: Age-Gender Deep Learning Model
- **Framework**: Caffe
- **Input Size**: 227x227 pixels
- **Classes**: Male, Female

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Limitations
- **Prototype Status**: This is a work-in-progress and not ready for production use
- **Accuracy Variations**: Performance may vary based on:
  - Image quality and resolution
  - Lighting conditions
  - Face angle and visibility
  - Image compression

### Ethical Considerations
- **Educational Purpose**: This tool is intended for research and educational purposes only
- **Bias Awareness**: Gender classification models may have inherent biases
- **Privacy Respect**: Always ensure proper consent before using on surveillance footage
- **Responsible Use**: Consider the ethical implications of gender classification in surveillance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Model Files
The application automatically downloads the following pre-trained models:
- `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb` - Face detection model
- `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt` - Face detection configuration
- `gender_deploy.prototxt` - Gender classification network architecture
- `gender_net.caffemodel` - Pre-trained gender classification weights

### Performance
- **Processing Speed**: ~5-15 FPS depending on hardware and video resolution
- **Memory Usage**: Approximately 500-1000 MB RAM during video processing
- **Supported Formats**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM, and other common video formats
- **Frame Limit**: Max 1000 frames per video for demo purposes

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Age estimation capabilities
- [ ] Emotion detection
- [ ] Multiple person tracking in video streams
- [ ] Enhanced accuracy with newer models
- [ ] Integration with actual CCTV systems
- [ ] Alert system for specific scenarios
- [ ] Mobile app development

## üìä Example Use Cases

1. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time demographic analysis of video surveillance feeds
2. **Research**: Academic studies on computer vision and AI in security applications
3. **Education**: Learning about video processing, face detection, and classification
4. **Prototyping**: Foundation for more advanced real-time surveillance systems
5. **Event Analysis**: Post-event analysis of recorded surveillance footage
